However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability\nlaws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\nAdditional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional\nagreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.\nHowever, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on\nyour sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other\nContributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against\nsuch Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional\nliability.\n\nAcceptance of the Licence\n\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I\nagree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence\nor by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules\nof applicable law.

Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it\nvalid and enforceable.\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions\nof this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required\nand reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the\nLicence.
