<p> EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2
                      EUPL © the European Union 2007, 2016</p>
<p>This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as
defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of
the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the
extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).</p>
<p>The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Work:</p>
<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">    Licensed under the EUPL</code></pre></div><p>or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.</p>
<ol>
<li>Definitions</li>
</ol>
<p>In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>‘The Licence’: this Licence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the
Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
Code as the case may be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the
Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;
this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country
mentioned in Article 15.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
convenient for people to study and modify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which
is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates
the Work under the Licence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under
the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of
the Work under the terms of the Licence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,
renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Scope of the rights granted by the Licence</li>
</ol>
<p>The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright
vested in the Original Work:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,</li>
<li>reproduce the Work,</li>
<li>modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,</li>
<li>communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case
may be, the Work,</li>
<li>distribute the Work or copies thereof,</li>
<li>lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,</li>
<li>sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.</p>
<p>In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.</p>
<p>The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights
to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Communication of the Source Code</li>
</ol>
<p>The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,
in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Limitations on copyright</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
limitations thereto.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Obligations of the Licensee</li>
</ol>
<p>The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:</p>
<p>Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and
a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.</p>
<p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of
the Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee
(becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions
on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
Licence.</p>
<p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed
under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done
under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to
this Licence. Should the Licensee&#39;s obligations under the Compatible Licence
conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
Compatible Licence shall prevail.</p>
<p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available
for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.</p>
<p>Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the copyright notice.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Chain of Authorship</li>
</ol>
<p>The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
power and authority to grant the Licence.</p>
<p>Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
has the power and authority to grant the Licence.</p>
<p>Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
terms of this Licence.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Disclaimer of Warranty</li>
</ol>
<p>The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.</p>
<p>For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’
basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.</p>
<p>This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Disclaimer of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability
laws as far such laws apply to the Work.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Additional agreements</li>
</ol>
<p>While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.
However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on
your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional
liability.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Acceptance of the Licence</li>
</ol>
<p>The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I
agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence
or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules
of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work
or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Information to the public</li>
</ol>
<p>In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of
electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work
from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a
website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the
applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Termination of the Licence</li>
</ol>
<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.</p>
<p>Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
remain in full compliance with the Licence.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Miscellaneous</li>
</ol>
<p>Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
agreement between the Parties as to the Work.</p>
<p>If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions
of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required
and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the
Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version
number.</p>
<p>All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
their choice.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Jurisdiction</li>
</ol>
<p>Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a
Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty
on the Functioning of the European Union,</p>
</li>
<li><p>any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the
interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts
its primary business.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="15">
<li>Applicable Law</li>
</ol>
<p>Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State
where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,</p>
</li>
<li><p>this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,
residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.</p>
</li>
</ul>
